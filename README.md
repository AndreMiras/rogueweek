# Rogueweek

Write a Rogue game, under the same type of constraints as those found in PICO-8.

We chose to use Pyxel instead of PICO-8 because it's free. Although there are
less constraints, it's still a lot of fun.


# Features to implement

- randomly generated levels
- turned based gameplay
- sequential actions required to finish a level (key, door, boss)
- more that one level
- keep stats and scores
